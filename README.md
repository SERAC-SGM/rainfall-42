<h2>PREAMBLE</h2>

This project is the second cybersecurity project of Ecole 42 (see [snow_crash](https://github.com/SERAC-SGM/Snow-crash)). It consists in completing 15 CTF (Capture the Flag) challenges, mostly focusing on Buffer Overflow attacks. 

<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>

To complete this project, we will have to use a VM with an ISO that has been provided with the subject. If the configuration is right, we will get a simple prompt with an IP and a login request.
We have to find a way to read the `.pass` file with the `levelX` user account of the next level (X = number of the next level).
